Widget Overview
===============

The main purpose of a widget is to display a functional control within an HTML page. A widget has a template to generate its own HTML, and a set of parameters that control how it will be displayed. It can also reference resources - JavaScript or CSS files that support the widget.

When defining Widgets, some parameters with be static - they will stay constant for the whole lifetime of the application. Some parameters are dynamic - they may change for every request. To ensure thread-safety, a separate widget instance is created for every request, and dynamic parameters are only set on an instance. Static parameters are set by subclassing a widget. For example::

    # Initialisation
    class MyWidget(Widget):
        id = 'myid'

    # In a request
    my_widget = MyWidget.req()
    my_widget.value = 'my value'

To make initialisation more concise, the ``__new__`` method on ``Widget`` is overriden, so it creates subclasses, rather than instances. The following code is equivalent to that above::

    # Initialisation
    MyWidget = Widget(id='myid')

In practice, you will rarely need to explictly create an instance, using ``req()``. If the ``display`` or ``validate`` methods are called on a Widget class, they automatically create an instance. For example, the following are equivalent::

    # Explicit creation
    my_widget = MyWidget.req()
    my_widget.value = 'my value'
    my_widget.display()

    # Implicit creation
    MyWidget.display(value='my value')


Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The parameters are how the user of the widget controls its display and behaviour. Parameters exist primarily for documentation purposes, although they do have some run-time effects. When creating widgets, it's important to decide on a convenient set of parameters for the user of the widget, and to document these.

A parameter definition looks like this::

    import tw2.core as twc
    class MyTextField(twc.Widget):
        size = twc.Param('The size of the field', default=30)
        validator = twc.LengthValidator(max=30)
        highlight = twc.Variable('Region to highlight')

In this case, :class:`TextField` gets all the parameters of its base class, :class:`tw2.core.widget` and defines a new parameter - :attr:`size`. A widget can also override parameter in its base class, either with another :class:`tw2.core.Param` instance, or a new default value.

.. autoclass:: tw2.core.Param
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.Variable
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.ChildParam
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.ChildVariable


Code Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~

Subclasses of Widget can override the following methods. It is not recommended to override any other methods, e.g. display, validate, __init__.

.. automethod:: tw2.core.widgets.Widget.post_define
.. automethod:: tw2.core.widgets.Widget.prepare
.. automethod:: tw2.core.widgets.Widget.request
.. automethod:: tw2.core.widgets.Widget.fetch_data
.. automethod:: tw2.core.widgets.Widget.validated_request


Widget Hierarchy
================

Widgets can be arranged in a hierarchy. This is useful for applications like layouts, where the layout will be a parent widget and fields will be children of this. There are four roles a widget can take in the hierarchy, depending on the base class used:

.. autoclass:: tw2.core.Widget
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.CompoundWidget
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.RepeatingWidget
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.DisplayOnlyWidget

**Value Propagation**

An important feature of the hierarchy is value propagation. When the value is set for a compound or repeating widget, this causes the value to be set for the child widgets. In general, a leaf widget takes a scalar type as a value, a compound widget takes a dict or an  object, and a repeating widget takes a list.

The hierarchy also affects the generation of compound ids, and validation.

**Identifier**

In general, a widget needs to have an identifier. Without an id, it cannot participate in value propagation or validation, and it does not get an id= attribute. For widgets with an id, *compound_id* is generated for the id= attribute, by joining it's parent and all ancestors' ids. The default separator is colon (:), resulting in compound ids like "form:sub_form:field".

There are some exceptions to this:

 * Some widgets do not need an id (e.g. Label, Spacer) and provide a default id of None.
 * The child of a RepeatingWidget must not have an id. The repetition is used instead to generate compound  ids.
 * DisplayOnlyWidget takes the id from its child, but uses None for generating compound ids.

**Deep Children**

This is a feature that helps have a form layout that doesn't exactly match the database layout. For example, we might have a sinlge database table, with fields like title, customer, start_date, end_date. We want to display this in a Form that's broken up into two FieldSets. Without deep children, the FieldSets would have to have ids, and field makes would be dotted, like info.title. The deep children feature lets us set the id to None::

    class MyForm(twf.Form):
        class child(twc.CompoundWidget):
            class info(twf.FieldSet):
                id = None
                title = twf.TextField()
                customer = twf.TextField()
            class dates(twf.FieldSet):
                id = None
                start_date = twf.TextField()
                end_date = twf.TextField()

Now, when a value like ``{'title': 'my title'}`` is passed to MyForm, this will propage correctly.


Template
========

Every widget has a template, this is core to the widget concept. ToscaWidgets aims to support any templating engine that support the ``buffet`` interface, which is an attempt by the TurboGears project to create a standard interface for template libraries. In practice, there are a few differences between template engines that the buffet interface does not standardise. So, ToscaWidgets has some template-language hooks, and support is primarily for: Genshi, Mako, Kid and Cheetah.

The :attr:`template` parameter takes the form ``engine_name:template_path``. The ``engine_name`` is the name that the template engine defines in the ``python.templating.engines`` entry point, e.g. ``genshi`` or ``mako``. Specifying the engine name is compulsory, unlike previous versions of ToscaWidgets. The ``template_path`` is a string the engine can use to locate the template; usually this is dot-notation that mimics the semantics of Python's import statement, e.g. ``myapp.templates.mytemplate``.

.. autoclass:: tw2.core.template.EngineManager


Resources
=========

Widgets often need to access resources, such as JavaScript or CSS files. A key feature of widgets is the ability to automatically serve such resources, and insert links into appropriate sections of the page, e.g. ``<HEAD>``. There are several parts to this:

 * Widgets can define resources they use, using the :attr:`resources` parameter.
 * When a Widget is displayed, it registers resources in request-local storage, and with the resource server.
 * The resource injection middleware detects resources in request-local storage, and rewrites the generated page to include appropriate links.
 * The resource server middleware serves static files used by widgets
 * Widgets can also access resources at display time, e.g. to get links

**Defining Resources**

To define a resource, just add a :class:`tw2.core.Resource` subclass to the widget's :attr:`resources` parameter. It is also possible to append to :attr:`resources` from within the :meth:`prepare` method. The following resource types are available:

.. autoclass:: tw2.core.CSSLink
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.JSLink
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.JSSource
.. autoclass:: tw2.core.JSFuncCall

Resources are widgets, but follow a slightly different lifecycle. Resource subclasses are passed into the :attr:`resources` parameter. An instance is created for each request, but this is only done at the time of the parent Widget's :meth:`display` method. This gives widgets a chance to add dynamic resources in their :meth:`prepare` method.


Middleware
==========


The WSGI middleware has three functions:

 * Request-local storage
 * Configuration
 * Resource injection

**Configuration**

In general, ToscaWidgets configuration is done on the middleware instance. At the beginning of each request, the middleware stores a reference to itself in request-local storage. So, during a request, a widget can consult request-local storage, and get the configuration for the middleware active in that request. This allows multiple applications to use ToscaWidgets, with different configurations, in a single Python environment.

Configuration is passed as keyword arguments to the middleware constructor. The available parameters are:

.. autoclass:: tw2.core.middleware.Config


Declarative Instantiation
=========================

Instantiating compound widgets can result in less-than-beautiful code. To help alleviate this, widgets can be defined declaratively, and this is the recommended approach. A definition looks like this::

    class MovieForm(twf.TableForm):
        id = twf.HiddenField()
        year = twf.TextField()
        desc = twf.TextArea(rows=5)

Any class members that are subclasses of Widget become children. All the children get their ``id`` from the name of the member variable. Note: it is important that all children are defined like ``id = twf.HiddenField()`` and not ``id = twf.HiddenField``. Otherwise, the order of the children will not be preserved.

It is possible to define children that have the same name as parameters, using this syntax. However, doing so does prevent a widget overriding a parameter, and defining a child with the same name. If you need to do this, you must use a throwaway name for the member variable, and specify the id explicitly, e.g.::

    class MovieForm(twf.TableForm):
        resources = [my_resource]
        id = twf.HiddenField()
        noname = twf.TextArea(id='resources')


**Nesting and Inheritence**

Nested declarative definitions can be used, like this::

    class MyForm(twf.Form):
        class child(twf.TableLayout):
            b = twf.TextArea()
            x = twf.Label(text='this is a test')
            c = twf.TextField()

Inheritence is supported - a subclass gets the children from the base class, plus any defined on the subclass. If there's a name clash, the subclass takes priority. Multiple inheritence resolves name clashes in a similar way. For example::

    class MyFields(twc.CompoundWidget):
        b = twf.TextArea()
        x = twf.Label(text='this is a test')
        c = twf.TextField()

    class TableFields(MyFields, twf.TableLayout):
        pass

    class ListFields(MyFields, twf.ListLayout):
        b = twf.TextField()

**Proxying children**

Without this feature, double nesting of classes is often necessary, e.g.::

    class MyForm(twf.Form):
        class child(twf.TableLayout):
            b = twf.TextArea()

Proxying children means that if :class:`RepeatingWidget` or :class:`DisplayOnlyWidget` have :attr:`children` set, this is passed to their :attr:`child`. The following is equivalent to the definition above::

    class MyForm(twf.Form):
        child = twf.TableLayout()
        b = twf.TextArea()

And this is used by classes like :class:`TableForm` and :class:`TableFieldSet` to allow the user more concise widget definitions::

    class MyForm(twf.TableForm):
        b = twf.TextArea()


**Automatic ID**

Sub classes of :class:`Page` that do not have an id, will have the id automatically set to the name of the class.


Widgets as Controllers
======================

Sometimes widgets will want to define controller methods. This is particularly useful for Ajax widgets. Any widget can have a :meth:`request` method, which is called with a WebOb :class:`Request` object, and must return a WebOb :class:`Response` object, like this::

    class MyWidget(twc.Widget):
        id = 'my_widget'
        @classmethod
        def request(cls, req):
            resp = webob.Response(request=req, content_type="text/html; charset=UTF8")
            # ...
            return resp

For the :meth:`request` method to be called, the widget must be registered with the :class:`ControllersApp` in the middleware. By default, the path is constructed from /controllers/, and the widget's id. A request to /controllers/ refers to a widget with id ``index``. You can specify :attr:`controllers_prefix` in the configuration.

For convenience, widgets that have a :meth:`request` method, and an :attr:`id` will be registered automatically. By default, this uses a global :class:`ControllersApp` instance, which is also the default controllers_app for :func:`make_middleware`. If you want to use multiple controller applications in a single python instance, you will need to override this. Set :attr:`tw2_controllers` as a global variable, and this will affect all widgets defined in that module. Set this to None to disable automatic registration. You can also manually register widgets::

    mw = twc.make_middleware()
    mw.controllers.register(MyWidget, 'mywidget')

**Methods to override**

    `view_request`
        Instance method - get self and req. load from db

    `validated_request`
        Class method - get cls and validated data

    `ajax_request`
        Return python data that is automatically converted to an ajax response


General Considerations
======================

**Request-Local Storage**

ToscaWidgets needs access to request-local storage. In particular, it's important that the middleware sees the request-local information that was set when a widget is instatiated, so that resources are collected correctly.

The function tw2.core.request_local returns a dictionary that is local to the current request. Multiple calls in the same request always return the same dictionary. The default implementation of request_local is a thread-local system, which the middleware clears before and after each request.

In some situations thread-local is not appropriate, e.g. twisted. In this case the application will need to monkey patch request_local to use appropriate request_local storage.

**pkg_resources**

tw2.core aims to take advantage of pkg_resources where it is available, but not to depend on it. This allows tw2.core to be used on Google App Engine. pkg_resources is used in two places:

 * In ResourcesApp, to serve resources from modules, which may be zipped eggs. If pkg_resources is not available, this uses a simpler system that does not support zipped eggs.
 * In EngingeManager, to load a templating engine from a text string, e.g. "genshi". If pkg_resources is not available, this uses a simple, built-in mapping that covers the most common template engines.

**Framework Interface**

ToscaWidgets is designed to be standalone WSGI middeware and not have any framework interactions. However, when using ToscaWidgets with a framework, there are some configuration settings that need to be consistent with the framework, for correct interaction. Future vesions of ToscaWidgets may include framework-specific hooks to automatically gather this configuration.
