ToscaWidgets 2 Documentation
============================

ToscaWidgets aims to be a practical and useful widgets framework that helps people build interactive websites with compelling features, faster and easier. Widgets are re-usable web components that can include a template, server-side code and JavaScripts/CSS resources. The library aims to be: flexible, reliable, documented, performant, and as simple as possible.

ToscaWidgets comes in two main packages:

 * tw2.core - the core functionality needed to use widgets in an app
 * tw2.devtools - documentation, unit tests, widget browser, library template, resource collator

The idea is that only tw2.core needs to be installed on a server. It has minimal dependencies, while tw2.devtools has more, e.g. sphinx.

In addition, widget library packages follow the same naming convention, for example:

 * tw2.forms - Basic forms library
 * tw2.dynforms - Dynamic forms - client-side and Ajax
