Welcome to ToscaWidgets 2's documentation!
==========================================

ToscaWidgets aims to be a practical and useful widgets framework that helps people build interactive websites with compelling features, faster and easier. Widgets are re-usable web components that can include a template, server-side code and JavaScripts/CSS resources. The library aims to be: flexible, reliable, documented, performant, and as simple as possible.

Some widgets libraries built with ToscaWidgets:

 * tw.forms - Basic forms library
 * tw.sa_forms - Forms with an SQLAlchemy back-end
 * tw.dynforms - Dynamic forms - client-side and Ajax
